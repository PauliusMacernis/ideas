# Ideas

The complete list of ideas for software development or other type of activities.

I was browsing through archive files and was making some screenshots of my past projects. By doing this, I realized I have many sketches on ideas that did not reach complete implementation. Why not sharing all of these ideas with the rest of the world, I thought...

Simonas says: [Flush app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=toilet.samruston.com.toilet&hl=en&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BB8AyLZqqRB2AbKJHmkstmg%3D%3D)
- [ ] Picking cardboard boxes out of shops and re-selling them.
- [ ] Website selling unique creative gifts. No for the generic gifts.
- [ ] Website on FAQ: vegetarianism, immunizations, etc.
- [ ] An open-source IT solution in a form of web system and cards for discount/overprice. The point is that some people get a discount while others get overprice after swiping during payment. The whole web system is dedicated to manage where the markup(?) overprice goes... Discount cards are issued for people living under the poverty level/line only. You may choose/pick to support people, products, look at what is supported by you buy using the discount card, etc. The supported one may be backed up to 100% in the best case scenario. The overprice/markup(?) would be/is based on statistics of poverty of the region. For example, ~20% of overpricing(markup) would be set for Lithuania, because ~1/5 of the population is currently living in poverty/under the poverty line.
- [ ] Website analyzing job postings all over the internet boards with the goal to make a personalized and smart real-time career adviser for every registered user. The user would pick the path, e.g. "web developer" and the system would pick the learning path based on current job-related trends. This project has been started by me some time ago, slowly going forward. Should I invest more time into it? 
[https://github.com/sugalvojau/veikt.com](https://github.com/sugalvojau/veikt.com)
- [ ] A book on questions "Every <profession> should know". This would be basically the list of many misunderstood or ignored (but very important to know!) topics of the <profession>. The book may be good for self-challenging from time to time, for job interviews, for other cases. This is the draft I am coming with for "Every web developer should know": 
 [https://github.com/sugalvojau/Questions](https://github.com/sugalvojau/Questions) , [https://sugalvojau.gitbooks.io/questions-it-person/content/](https://sugalvojau.gitbooks.io/questions-it-person/content/)
- [ ] The website collecting summaries of a very long content. For example: YouTube videos, books, articles, etc. Would be probably a good idea to make some sort of plugin for the web browser as well. In this way you would be notified if any summary for the URL you are seeing already exists. So maybe you may read/watch/listen to the short summary instead of spending the time on the whole content.
- [ ] One open-source table summarizing and referencing the science-based information on the needs of a living organism. For example, "Nutrition of a human" - the table listing human needs in order everybody to live under healthy conditions. In the case of this example there would be no primary intention on giving the instructions on in-taking a specific product you could find in the store, for example: avocado, potato, strawberries, etc. Knowing how much exactly and which type of fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, minerals to use is the point here. Food covering the entire list of the elements would follow later. Some draft-like start of this project has been made here: 
 [https://poreikiu-baze.gitbooks.io/mityba/content/](https://poreikiu-baze.gitbooks.io/mityba/content/)
- [ ] HXZl7: Bringing together a community of people individually donating/investing their income into the society. This community would be acting towards cruelty-free, friendly, healthy, happy, positively thinking and conscious society: direct individual donations to homeless people in cities, establishment of non-profit organizations helping animals, lots of related initiatives and activities. It may look like the game in which group of people are racing for the most efficiently made individual donation, but it is also the group of people living for real under the same life mission. All the new members would start with donating (up to) 10% of their last income to the initiatives of their own choice. The intentions of community members stay the same during all the time - the members have to individually donate after every income got, have to never stop donating, have to never donate less percent than before, and (have to) finally reach the level of knowledge and skills to be able to live while constantly donating the entire 100% of the income.
- [ ] Making a video channel the team of which is traveling around the countries and towns by collecting answers to the only question: "What is the best memory you have?"
- [ ] Open source individual budget tracking and planing system allowing to connect into private or public "budget circles" with other known and unknown people, split bills in between, provide tips on budget, investments, etc.
- [ ] TJ8RP: Website collecting pictures and other info of products, including the related barcode, nutrition information, prices in different shops, etc. Various filters to filter the products and ingredients, various statistical conclusions from the information provided, for example, what is the cheapest way to get 100% of daily norm of calcium, etc.
- [ ] WHE5C: Website of one page containing statistical real-time (as possible) information on the current economic state. Many trends, charts and similar stuff shown for the user. Open source, for sure.
- [ ] 1C500: Organization established and/or represented by emigrants from all over the world. The point of this is to have tool by using which everywhere living emigrants can impact the situation in the own country (for example, Lithuania) remotely.
- [ ] HWYTK: Composing and shipping bundles of identity's experience (for example of country, company, profession, etc.).
- [ ] RQQMT: A website crawling and aggregating all resources (like online boards) giving things for free. The list of projects asking for donation may also be here.
- [ ] 7I49N: The Shop selling everything from/on fruits: fruit mixes to take away, fruits to eat at the place, info about every fruit in sale, fruits museum (like a garden or so), open public fruits market (anyone can sell), sculptures and decorations out of fruits, anything else that may come into a mind. All fruits are carefully washed in eyes of customers (if they choose so) and are ready to consume immediately. All fruits are organic. Seminars on fruits cultivation, nutrition and many other topics could also be found here.
- [ ] Company designing and selling unique table or outside games. Anyone can visit the company to play the experimental games (games not selling yet).
- [ ] Group of people willing to get into one good habit from the options provided by a group for at least 21 day in a row. People who keep up with the habit well may add the next habit for another 21 day or remove the old one. The point here is to strengthen the personal will, have some people to talk about the same, and keep on going for as long as possible. Examples of the habits for adoption: daily cold shower, daily exercising, daily meditation, etc.
- [ ] 4VJL4: Crowdsourcing platform for children of schools. The point of this is to promote kids and schools with extra money, knowledge, skills and opportunities that is sometimes necessary in order for kids to learn in a more creative environment with more professionals involved. This also grows a sense for kids on what the community around them is, what it likes and what it means to be funded by a community in general. Experiencing and understanding the sense of what the community funds in general links participating kids into success of integrating to a community later in life. It also naturally links to a prosperity of a community itself, because such activities increase the density of individuals who understands well the needs of a community. Kids are allowed to submit their proposals-projects in case the content of it is covered by official program adopted by a school.
- [ ] 825KK: Open source wizard-like website allowing people to create their own rent agreements. The priority is set for real estate rent-type agreements, but car rent agreements, other things rent agreements may follow easily.
- [ ] An app that pops up a random contact at a random time in a year. It could also pop up some other list items to the screen. A few other examples following the same pattern: a paragraph of the book chosen (this may pop up anytime, but not in a random sequence), places to visit (this may pop up random places near by you from a public list, like trip advisor or so).
- [ ] The list of "transportation services" for people traveling from point A to point B provided by locals. Point A and point B are mainly some sort of well known places (like objects visiting by tourists, nearby towns, cities). Locals offer their own transportation services for tourists traveling from point A to point B but locals add their own extras on top as well (this extras part is mandatory and the most important part). For example, if you are two tourists traveling from point A to point B you may expect buying a "transportation package" that contains riding the horse from point A to a farmer's house in the middle between point A and B, having lunch with the family around the same table, learning how to plant potatoes for a few hours (because farmers do this kind of activity today), taking sauna with locals in the evening, sleeping in a hay "bed" provided by locals, having be brought to point B by a family member in the morning at the time he/she is going to work nearby the place B. Some "transportation services" may cost more than regular transportation services, because of some extra fancy stuff and the wish for your own laziness involved. However, it may also be completely free or even a little profitable if you choose transportation services with some volunteering/job involved. It is just one more way to experience the rhythm and traditions of locals. It may also become the interesting way you may travel around the world for free in months or years.
- [ ] The network of people exchanging their own real estate for a month per every year. For example, a network may consists of people from different countries like Brazil, Spain, Lithuania, Australia, South Africa, Mongolia, East Timor, Jordan, Peru, Morocco, Cambodia, Comoros, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Ireland, Chile, Benin, Suriname, Estonia, Iraq, Slovenia, etc. Each member of the network has to give his/her place for another member of the network to live in for at least a month per every year.
- [ ] Web app (script) that allows people to set up a personal salary calculator. Different people have different requirements for a conditions within a working environment. For example, you may consider getting a lower salary if the lunch is being provided and paid by the company all the time, you may consider higher salary if you have to use your own car for work-related tasks to do, you may consider getting lower salary if you are learning things you like while you work, you may consider higher salary if you have to work on the tasks you don't like at all, etc. The min and/or max of the salary may also exist, the lack of too many requirements may make the new job offer unacceptable at all. The calculator configuration asks you for the requirements, priorities (weight) of each requirement and some other data. The final result is the survey-like calculator which could be shared with the company that offers you a job. The company takes the survey you just configured and the preliminary salary will become shown based on the picks of the company.
- [ ] Archive of flyers related to elections in the past. People related to flyers are tagged on.
- [ ] Q5VR9: System (web, app, another) helping people to organize their own to-do/wish/plan/etc lists according to purpose of their own life, base values, etc. The system consists of hard to answer questions, tasks that help to answer hard to answer questions, suggestions for experiences to get on in order to balance the entire lifetime and life areas, etc. The first point of the system is to get you to know yourself, the second point of the system is to lead you by giving every possible support while you are following your own unique path.
- [ ] WYl0N: Map/book/travel guide/travel agency on "The List of what emigrants miss the most when remembering their home place.".
- [ ] S5AQY: Creating a brand-alike profile of self and like-minded people, arranging one quite extraordinary and always up-to-date vacation plan for a like-minded (the profile-matching) tourists.
- [ ] The company looking for IT-related projects in economically strong areas like New York City, Los Angeles, Paris, Chicago, London, Toronto, Sydney, Seattle, Berlin, Vienna, etc. and sending experienced IT people (developers, project managers, etc.) to remote and most of the time quite poor parts of the world (like Iqaluit, remote places of Baltic states, etc.) to develop and teach developing the projects one after another until locals will be able to work independently in finding and developing. Yoga, psychology lectures and/or other practices increasing self-awareness may also be part of this company (as part of the company culture maybe), because remote and poor districts sometimes relate to high crime density, people with unstable psychological state, etc.
- [ ] FX6RA: Global jar of assets - several bank accounts (and warehouses) acting as one people can send their assets to. Any person of the world can withdraw the portion of the existing assets from the jar regardless of the location, being registered in the system, etc. The point of the jar is that the person who sends assets sets the filter for the profile of "the receiver". The filter consist of many psychological-like tests and "to-do"s required to pass for a person before withdrawing. For example, the sender may set the "stronger" filter requiring the receiver to successfully pass Milgram's experiment test, pass the test of knowledge after reading a specific book on personal health, visiting yoga center daily for at least half of the year, and go through 10-days Vipassana course at least 3 times before being able to withdraw bigger amount. Or set the simpler filter for the things like food to receive, for example: volunteering for an hour in a local comunity.
- [ ] CADUX: Translating lectures of well known psychologists to Lithuanian. Put all under YouTube, have Facebook account, etc. Many people who cannot speak foreign language have a need for a psychology-based advice.
- [ ] A pathwalk as a timeline of whatewer, e.g. history.
- [ ] FDGEE: Web software development for organizations promoting green-lifestyle.
- [ ] Extract questions out of pdf and random;y ask these. May also be configured to extract random topics, random lines, etc, - good for learning.
- [ ] Balance assets
- [ ] Contraversial QA
- [ ] DateTime info collection
- [ ] Hive of the culture - opensource open community dedicated to get info on culture in the area X
- [ ] The list based on occupieable items. E.g. you come, make a list, share it, first comes and reserves the item, then second comes and may reserve any other but th efirst one, etc. The faster is the user the more choises he/she has.
- [ ] Responsible time: Float, Toggl, Jira, Slack, OS time tracker
- [ ] World simulation: A-B-C game
- [ ] Extension monitoring how long you are on the same web page, e.g. Facebook. If too much - warn the user.
 
 
Do you know anyone who has successfully implemented any ideas on this list? Let me know, I will add the link to the result. 
Let me also know if you found your favourite. 
 
I am planning to continue working on the implementation of the most impactive one. 
The order of ideas is random at the moment. 
 
Best wishes!
