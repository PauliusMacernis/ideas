# Ideas

The complete list of ideas for software development or other type of activities.

I was browsing through archive files and was making some screenshots of my past projects. By doing this, I realized I have many sketches on ideas that did not reach complete implementation. Why not sharing all of these ideas with the rest of the world, I thought...

You can find the complete list here:

- [ ] Chain of shops selling production made by locals only.
- [ ] The website seeking to find what is made of what. Parent-child connection.

The individual and group/global answer is the final outcome.

Simonas says: [Flush app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=toilet.samruston.com.toilet&hl=en&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BB8AyLZqqRB2AbKJHmkstmg%3D%3D)
- [ ] Picking cardboard boxes out of shops and re-selling them.
- [ ] Website selling unique creative gifts. No for the generic gifts.
- [ ] Website on FAQ: vegetarianism, immunizations, etc.
- [ ] An open-source IT solution in a form of web system and cards for discount/overprice. The point is that some people get a discount while others get overprice after swiping during payment. The whole web system is dedicated to manage where the markup(?) overprice goes... Discount cards are issued for people living under the poverty level/line only. You may choose/pick to support people, products, look at what is supported by you buy using the discount card, etc. The supported one may be backed up to 100% in the best case scenario. The overprice/markup(?) would be/is based on statistics of poverty of the region. For example, ~20% of overpricing(markup) would be set for Lithuania, because ~1/5 of the population is currently living in poverty/under the poverty line.
- [ ] Website analyzing job postings all over the internet boards with the goal to make a personalized and smart real-time career adviser for every registered user. The user would pick the path, e.g. "web developer" and the system would pick the learning path based on current job-related trends. This project has been started by me some time ago, slowly going forward. Should I invest more time into it?  
[https://github.com/sugalvojau/veikt.com](https://github.com/sugalvojau/veikt.com)
- [ ] A book on questions "Every <profession> should know". This would be basically the list of many misunderstood or ignored (but very important to know!) topics of the <profession>. The book may be good for self-challenging from time to time, for job interviews, for other cases. This is the draft I am coming with for "Every web developer should know":  
 [https://github.com/sugalvojau/Questions](https://github.com/sugalvojau/Questions) , [https://sugalvojau.gitbooks.io/questions-it-person/content/](https://sugalvojau.gitbooks.io/questions-it-person/content/)
- [ ] The website collecting summaries of a very long content. For example: YouTube videos, books, articles, etc. Would be probably a good idea to make some sort of plugin for the web browser as well. In this way you would be notified if any summary for the URL you are seeing already exists. So maybe you may read/watch/listen to the short summary instead of spending the time on the whole content.
- [ ] One open-source table summarizing and referencing the science-based information on the needs of a living organism. For example, "Nutrition of a human" - the table listing human needs in order everybody to live under healthy conditions. In the case of this example there would be no primary intention on giving the instructions on in-taking a specific product you could find in the store, for example: avocado, potato, strawberries, etc. Knowing how much exactly and which type of fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, minerals to use is the point here. Food covering the entire list of the elements would follow later. Some draft-like start of this project has been made here:

- [ ] HXZl7: Bringing together a community of people individually donating/investing their income into the society. This community would be acting towards cruelty-free, friendly, healthy, happy, positively thinking and conscious society: direct individual donations to homeless people in cities, establishment of non-profit organizations helping animals, lots of related initiatives and activities. It may look like the game in which group of people are racing for the most efficiently made individual donation, but it is also the group of people living for real under the same life mission. All the new members would start with donating (up to) 10% of their last income to the initiatives of their own choice. The intentions of community members stay the same during all the time - the members have to individually donate after every income got, have to never stop donating, have to never donate less percent than before, and (have to) finally reach the level of knowledge and skills to be able to live while constantly donating the entire 100% of the income.
- [ ] Making a video channel the team of which is traveling around the countries and towns by collecting answers to the only question: "What is the best memory you have?"
- [ ] Open source individual budget tracking and planing system allowing to connect into private or public "budget circles" with other known and unknown people, split bills in between, provide tips on budget, investments, etc.
- [ ] TJ8RP: Website collecting pictures and other info of products, including the related barcode, nutrition information, prices in different shops, etc. Various filters to filter the products and ingridients, various statistical conlusions from the information provided, for example, what is the cheepest way to get 100% of daily norm of calcium, etc.
- [ ] WHE5C: Website of one page containing statistical real-time (as possible) information on the current economic state. Many trends, charts and similar stuff shown for the user. Open source, for sure.
- [ ] 1C500: Organization established and/or represented by emigrants from all over the world. The point of this is to have tool by using which everywhere living emigrants can impact the situation in the own contry (for example, Lithuania) remotely.
- [ ] HWYTK: Composing and shipping unique bundles of identities (for example of countries).
 
  
Do you know anyone who has successfully implemented any ideas on this list? Let me know, I will add the link to the result.  
Let me also know if you found your favourite.  
  
I am planning to continue working on the implementation of the most impactive one.  
The order of ideas is random at the moment.  
  
Best wishes!
